# ML/security playground

Dependencies:
 * [PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod) for magic,
 * [BCC](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) for dark magic,
 * [Simhash](https://github.com/leonsim/simhash) for locality sensitive hashing (kind of magic as well)

collect.py - Samples interesting syscalls and represents them in some silly VSM
learn.py - Creates model for anomaly detection using PyOD

Absolutely nothing to see here yet.
